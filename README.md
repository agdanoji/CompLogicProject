Two problems implemented in IDP-Web IDE are as follows:
1. Shortest path problem. 
-version 1 :sp1.idp
uses the most basic definition for the transitive closure to find shortest path.
-version 2 :sp2.idp
using a different definition for reaches(x,y) predicate in theory.
-version 3-sp3.idp
using unary reachable relation instead of the binary reaches relation.

2. Deterministic Finite Automaton
-version1 :dfa1.idp
-version2 :dfa2.idp (improved performance)
